Promise code doesn&#39;t look too different from regular node callbacks
or event emitters, except that you use a second callback for the error. And
you&#39;re still not convinced that there is any benefit to using <code>.then()</code> to
create new promises.</p>
<p>Okay then. Lets take things to the next level.</p>
<p>Using <code>.then()</code>, you can attach the callbacks later if you want.</p>
<p>For example <code>fs.readFileAsync(file)</code> returns a promise. That promise is a value,
so you can put that in a var, or return it from a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var filePromise = fs.readFileAsync(file);
filePromise.done(function(res) { ... }, function(err) {});</code></pre>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s still not much of an improvement. How about this then? You can
attach more than one callback to a promise if you like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">filePromise.done(function(res) { uploadData(url, res); });
filePromise.done(function(res) { saveLocal(url, res); },
    function(err), {});
// etc</code></pre>
<p>Hey, this is beginning to look more and more like streams - they too can be
piped to multiple destinations. But unlike streams, you can attach more
callbacks and get the value even <em>after</em> the file reading operation completes.</p>
<p>The promise will cache the value, and call your callback right after the next
tick. The file reading operation is always done only once - no need to repeat
it.</p>
<p>All of this makes it easier when you need to switch code that was previously
sync but had to become async for some reason.</p>
<p>For example: imagine that you need to get some stats about two file versions</p>
<ul>
<li>like number of lines in both versions and the number of lines in their diff:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-js">var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var diffFirstOther = diff(first, other);

var firstLines = first.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length,
    otherLines = other.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length;

var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split(&#39;\n&#39;);

var result = {
    first: firstLines,
    other: otherLines,
    diff: diffLines
};</code></pre>
<p>Later on, you figure out that the <code>diff()</code> function is kind of expensive in
terms of CPU power, so you want it to run in another process. Lets see what
are your options:</p>
<h4 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h4>
<p>You need to change the function <code>diff</code> to take a callback, and you move
the diffLines calculation inside. So far so good:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var first = files[0], other = files[1];
diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
    var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split(&#39;\n&#39;);
});
</code></pre>
<p>But wait, now the result needs to be inside that callback too.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var first = files[0], other = files[1];
diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
    var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split(&#39;\n&#39;);
    var result = {
        first: firstLines,
        other: otherLines,
        diff: diffLines
    };
});
var firstLines = first.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length,
    otherLines = other.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length;
</code></pre>
<p>This works but its horribly unintuitive because it looks like you&#39;re using
the variables <code>firstLines</code> and <code>otherLines</code> before they are available. So you
decide its best to move those lines at the top:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var firstLines = first.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length,
    otherLines = other.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length;

diff(first, other, function(err, diffFirstOther) {
    var diffLines = diffFirstOther.split(&#39;\n&#39;);
    var result = {
        first: firstLines,
        other: otherLines,
        diff: diffLines
    };
});</code></pre>
<h4 id="promises">Promises</h4>
<p>With promises our code can stay almost exactly the same. No need to move things
around to make them more intuitive. No need to figure out whether we need to
stuff other lines inside our callback because they have a dependency on the
result of that callback. Instead, we combine:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to attach callbacks whenever we want,</li>
<li>the power to create new promises by returning from <code>.then()</code>, and</li>
<li>the use of promise values to replace the original values</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-js">var first = files[0], other = files[1];
var pDiffFirstOther = diff(first, other);

var firstLines = first.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length,
    otherLines = other.split(&#39;\n&#39;).length;

var pDiffLines = pDiffFirstOther.then(function(diff) {
    return diff.split(&#39;\n&#39;);
});

var pResult = pDiffLines.then(function(diffLines) {
    return {
        first: firstLines,
        other: otherLines,
        diff: diffLines
    };
});</code></pre>
<p>Everything is exactly the same, except that we now have promises instead of
values.</p>
<p>Whenever we want to do some extra sync (or async) processing on these
promises, we can unpack them with <code>.then()</code> and apply our transformation inside
the callback, then return a new value which will be packed in a new promise.
No need to move code around to make it fit under the same callback.</p>
<p>That&#39;s pretty great, isn&#39;t it? But <a href="06-safety-of-then-exceptions.html">wait &#39;til you see what happens with
errors</a></p>
